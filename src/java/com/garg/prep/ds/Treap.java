 * A BST + Heap.
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treap
 * 
 * Treaps are binary search trees in which each node has both a key and a
 * priority. Randomized search trees use random priorities in treaps to achieve
 * good average-case performance. Sometimes the two terms are used
 * interchangeably. The treap has been commended for its elegance and
 * efficiency, and is now used in production applications ranging from wireless
 * networking to memory allocation to fast parallel aggregate set operations.
